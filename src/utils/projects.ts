Students can explore various apprenticeships, apply for positions, and gain detailed insights about potential career paths. With our AI chatbot, students can communicate in Swiss dialect (Mundart), express their interests, and receive personalized suggestions for the best-fitting apprenticeships. In this project, I was responsible for the web design and overall design aspects, ensuring a seamless user experience.",
